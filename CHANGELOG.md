# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- Six canonical contributor-role keys (writable, multivalued): `PRODUCER`, `ENGINEER`,
  `MIXER`, `ARRANGER`, `WRITER`, and `DJMIXER`. On ID3 the first five are stored in the
  involved-people list (`TIPL` in v2.4, `IPLS` in v2.3) using the de-facto Picard involvement
  strings (`producer`/`engineer`/`mix`/`arranger`/`DJ-mix`), so they interoperate with
  MusicBrainz Picard; `WRITER` rides a `TXXX:Writer` user frame. Cross-format parity: MP4
  `com.apple.iTunes` freeforms, Vorbis/Matroska native identity, and APE. Unmodeled
  involvements already present in a `TIPL`/`IPLS` frame (e.g. `mastering`) are preserved when
  a role is edited.

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Canonical `LYRICIST` tag key (writable, multivalued), modeled on `COMPOSER`, with
  cross-format parity: ID3 `TEXT` frame, MP4 `com.apple.iTunes` freeform, Vorbis/Matroska
  native identity, WAV/AIFF via embedded ID3, and APE. A legacy `TXXX:LYRICIST` frame reads
  onto `LYRICIST` and re-renders as the conformant `TEXT` frame on the next edit that
  touches it.
